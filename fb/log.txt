These didn't last long at Wednesday's market, because there were only 6 half pints. Should be more next week and hopefully asparagus will follow shortly.

Love BBQ? Chances are high that you just thought "YES!" and are now thinking about a slow smoked juicy tender rib where the meat just falls off the bone (we are). Absolutely Perfect Sauce & Seasoning has some of the best products to make your BBQ tastes like something off the Food Network, and we couldn't be happier to have them as a vendor! #BuyLocal #ClaytonFarmersMarket #BBQ
