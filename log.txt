These didn't last long at Wednesday's market, because there were only 6 half pints. Should be more next week and hopefully asparagus will follow shortly.

The bees required a little extra sleep this morning. If you have bee questions stop by opening day (May 3) and speak with Larry the "bee guy" in just 2 weeks!

I'd say, if you would like to feed bee's, you might want to winter over Asian mustards for early blossoms. 
This tat-soi plant wintered over, under the Cilantro Agribon row cover and is about to give me seeds. But I haven't seen many bees. .
